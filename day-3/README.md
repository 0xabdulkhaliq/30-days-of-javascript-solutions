### Exercises: Level 2

1. Write a script that prompt the user to enter base and height of the triangle and calculate an area of a triangle (area = 0.5 x b x h).

   ```sh
   Enter base: 20
   Enter height: 10
   The area of the triangle is 100
   ```

1. Write a script that prompt the user to enter side a, side b, and side c of the triangle and and calculate the perimeter of triangle (perimeter = a + b + c)

   ```sh
   Enter side a: 5
   Enter side b: 4
   Enter side c: 3
   The perimeter of the triangle is 12
   ```
